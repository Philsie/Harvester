## Info

# Structure  
To get an overview of the Code strukture take a look at the GenICam.dio file:  
    To open it either use the vscode extension Draaw.io or their Website [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)

# Setup  

## Package Installation
install the needed packages into a venv running python 3.6  
> bash setup.py

## Camera Setup:

# location for .cti files:

Place all .cti file into the cti folder or create a symlink with the ending .sym  
> ln -s /path/to/target /path/to/symlink.sym


# Ximea:

1. Ensure cti file or symlink is placed in ./cti directory

2. Ensure the necessay udev rule is placed in /etc/udev/ruled.d 

# Allied Vision:  

1. Download SDK from their website [Allied Vision](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/vimba-sdk/)  
***dont use Vimba_X !***

2. Install VimbaUSBTL  
    > sudo bash VimbaUSBTL/Install.sh

3. Copy .cti file into local cti folder
    > VimbaUSBTL/CTI/x86_64bit/VimbaUSBTL.cti

# IDS -- Not Working Currently

* Download https://en.ids-imaging.com/download-details/AB12776.html?os=linux&version=&bus=64&floatcalc=#anc-software-367
* cti files:
    > /lib/cti
* udev rules:
    > /local/scripts

# Configuration

* The load order of cti files and symlinks can be change with leading numbers.  
    * 00-VimbaUSBTL.cti is loaded before 02-ximea.gentl.cti. 

* to deactivate certain .cti files move them or their symlink into the ./cti/inactive directory.

* further configurations can be done inside the config.json file.
    *   Refrash rate of camera feed on frontend
    *   Logging of eventlet loop content
    *   Logging of a sign of live
    *   local port used for frontend
    *   Use of color-string library

# Usage

## Frontend:

1.  While in the main folder use this command to start the frontend
> .venv/bin/python GenICamFrontend.py  

2. To watch the programm outputs watch the log
> tail -f logs/GenICam.log

3. Start the execution by loading the website

## Hub:

1. import the GenICamHub.py file into your project  
2. create an GenICamHub object

### Managed by Hub
3. get a list of all running devices  
    > GenICamHub.list_Running_Devices
4. set the wanted Device as active using its id
    > GenICamHub.change_Device(id)
5. change Device settings by accessing GenICamHub.activeDevice  
    * example:
    > GenICamHub.activeDevice.exposure = Int
6. Trigger an Image
    > GenICamHub.activeDevice.trigger()
7. Read the Image
    * save creates an image file inside the images directory
    > GenICamHub.activeDevice.grab(save=Bool)

### Managed by your code

3. get a list of all running devices  
    > GenICamHub.list_Running_Devices
4. export the wanted device using its id   
    * this returnes a GenICam object
    > GenICamHub.export_Device(id)
5. change Device settings by accessing the GenICam Object
    * example:
    > GenICam.exposure = Int
6. Trigger an Image
    > GenICam.trigger()
7. Read the Image  
    * save creates an image file inside the images directory  
    * this returns an array of pixel values
    > GenICamHub.activeDevice.grab(save=Bool)



# known issues:

## Allied Vision:

* Stoppen working even though plugged in and found by Harvester  
    > GenTL exception: Operation timed out before completion. (Message from the source: Timeout while sending packet.) (ID: -1011)  
    fixed by replugging during testing

* Not starting properly at times
    indication: log stops after grabbing a device  
    fixed by restarting the program

## Ximea

* XiApi keeps spamming the terminal when running  
    check log for readable outputs

## IDS

* Camera not detected by Harvester

## Basler 

* Camera not detected by Harvester
